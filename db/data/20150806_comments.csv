2,"Yulduz","Computer security can be tricky to get just right",5
3,"Takako","Alison, long-running processes that need to manage a lot of temporary data (such as an operating system), the fragmentation will build up over time and require copying data from one place to another in a process known as defragmentation. This copying can be very costly in terms of CPU time, leading to temporary hiccups in responsiveness which can escalate into improper behavior in complex systems.",4
