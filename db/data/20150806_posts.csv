1,Linked Lists Support Interleaved Allocations,"The linked list data structure, as opposed to fixed or native arrays, supports ""interleaved allocations"". If you have multiple linked lists and a large block of memory (an ""arena"") such as a table in a database, it is possible for all of the lists to share that arena. By using a shared data structure for tracking used memory, each list can grow and shrink independent of the others -- its ""memory allocations"" can be interleaved with other lists. Native arrays on the other hand, must be discarded and re-allocated in order to grow. This results in significant potential for fragmentation and costly defragmentation procedures.",1
